# Brazilian Ultra Lemonade
When I first started cooking several years ago, I loved reading all the latest
recipes at [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/), and it was then that
I noticed the [lemonade Stella Parks](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-fresh-lemonade-recipe)
published there was really, really good.

All that nice lemon aroma in the lemonade made me wonder if maybe, there were
other things that lemonade in general might be missing. So I did some quick
research on lemonade recipes, took some time to refine my process, and this
recipe was born.

While my family loves its balanced flavor, the complexity of it - the stronger
lemon flavor, the creaminess of the condensed milk, the hints of bitterness -
might not appeal to everyone. Still, if you love food, I recommend you give it a
try!

*Active time*: about 30 minutes

*Total time*: about 4.5 hours minimum

## Ingredients
- 6 medium lemons (425 g)
- 1 cup sugar (200 g)
- 2/3 - 3/4 can sweetened condensed milk (330-375 g)
- 3(?) cups of water (750? mL)

## Equipment
- lemon juicer
- glass/ceramic cup for your juice
- glass/ceramic pitcher for your used rinds & sugar
- chopsticks, tongs, or strainer, to fish out the rinds later
- (optional) a second glass/ceramic pitcher for your doubly-used rinds

## Steps
1. Wash, clean, and dry your lemons. You are using their rinds in the recipe, so
   they need to be clean.
2. Roll your lemons on a clean surface. Applying pressure will make them easier
   to juice.
3. Halve your lemons, then juice. The acid in the juice will corrode metal, so
   reserve the juice in a glass/ceramic cup and cover.
4. Cut the halved lemons rinds again to get quarter or eighth rinds.
5. Place rinds in glass/ceramic pitcher, toss with the sugar, and cover.
6. Leave the rinds out at room temperature, and wait 4 hours (up to overnight)
   until the sugar is dissolved, stirring every 1-2 hours.
7. Pour some water (2 cups?) over the lemons to wash off the syrup on them.
8. Remove your lemon rinds.
9. (Optional) Soak the rinds in more water overnight in the fridge. This will
   help get the remaining syrup residue on them and produce a lightly-flavored
   "second" (niban) lemonade that can either be drunk by itself or added back to
   the lemonade later. Avoid letting it soak much longer than this, lest the
   liquid turn bitter.
10. Add the reserved lemon juice and condensed milk to your syrup-water mixture.
11. Add more water, sugar, and/or condensed milk to taste. Add less water if
    you're serving over ice, and more if not. Make sure you balance the flavors
    so neither the acidity, sweetness, nor creaminess stand out. You could add
    your niban lemonade at this point.

## Notes
You can also use this technique for limeade, mango-ade, and whatever other fruit
drink you desire. However, to me, much of the appeal is in its balance of flavors,
including the acidity and astringency, so it's best with lemons or limes.
